Converting a Website into a Mobile App
1. Hybrid Mobile Apps
- Use frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Ionic to build apps with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Wrap the website in a WebView component and enhance it with native features.
- Compatible with both iOS and Android platforms, avoiding the need for separate apps.

2. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- PWAs provide an app-like experience through modern web technologies.
- Accessible via browsers but can also be installed on a home screen, mimicking native apps.
- Cross-platform functionality without requiring separate hosting.

3. Native Apps
- Build separate apps for iOS and Android using respective languages:
  - iOS: Swift or Objective-C
  - Android: Java or Kotlin
- Offers more control and better access to native features but requires maintaining two codebases.
  
4. Hosting Considerations
- No need to host multiple websites; the mobile app fetches content from the same backend using APIs.
- Hosting can continue with services like Hostinger or GoDaddy.
- Apps are distributed through app stores like the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, each with specific guidelines for submission.
  
5. Summary
- Options include Hybrid Apps, Progressive Web Apps, or Native Apps.

Considerations
1. Development Resources:
  - Hybrid and PWA approaches can be more resource-efficient compared to developing separate native apps.
2. User Experience:
  - Native apps typically offer superior performance and integration with device features.
3. Maintenance:
  - PWAs and hybrid apps may simplify updates, as changes to the website can reflect in the app without requiring app store updates.

3. Development:
  - Utilize appropriate tools or services to build the app, ensuring it aligns with platform guidelines.
4. Testing:
  - Conduct thorough testing across devices to ensure functionality and performance.
5. Deployment:
  - Submit the app to relevant app stores, adhering to their submission requirements.

LeetCode 733. Flood Fill (Algorithm Explained) YouTube

This is how Paint's bucket fill works (Flood fill algorithm) YouTube

Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are fundamental graph traversal algorithms used to explore nodes in a graph systematically.
Depth-First Search (DFS):
- Traversal Method: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- Data Structure Used: Utilizes a stack, either explicitly or through recursion.
- Use Cases: Suitable for tasks like topological sorting, solving puzzles with a single solution, and detecting cycles in graphs.
Breadth-First Search (BFS):
- Traversal Method: Explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- Data Structure Used: Employs a queue to manage the frontier of exploration.
- Use Cases: Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal in trees, and scenarios requiring exploration of nodes in order of their distance from the source.

Why BFS Might Be Preferred Over DFS:
1. Shortest Path Discovery: BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs, making it preferable when the minimal number of edges to a target node is desired. GeeksforGeeks
2. Avoiding Infinite Loops: In graphs with cycles or infinite depth, BFS systematically explores nodes level by level, reducing the risk of getting trapped in cycles compared to DFS. Stack Overflow
3. Completeness: BFS will find a solution if one exists, as it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving deeper, ensuring all possible paths are considered. Medium
However, it's important to note that BFS can be more memory-intensive than DFS, as it stores all nodes at the current level in the queue.

In summary, while both algorithms have their merits, BFS is often the better choice for scenarios requiring the shortest path in unweighted graphs and when dealing with potentially infinite or cyclic graphs.
