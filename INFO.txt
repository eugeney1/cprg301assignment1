Technical Embroidery Info

Embroidery thread will be assumed to be 0.35 mm width.
We can use this information to make pixes, and the *resolution* of the
converted image to embroidery. 

We will also need to devise a way to figure out gradients. Perhaps some sort of
zipper effect? likekly need to look into the logic behind converting normal images
to vector images.

Likely some sort of fill logic aswell.
 
Can just reduce the resolution of the inputed image and use pixel art?

DSB format basics

the top of each file will look like this. anything with an X is unique
The amount of spaces is important

"""
LA:~temp.qe DSC.QEP
ST:      X
CO:  X
+X:    X
-X:    X
+Y:    X
-Y:    X
AX:+    X
AY:+    X
"""

ST -> stitch count
CO -> amount of colour switches
+X, -X -> distance traveled in the X axis, used to tell the machine the width
+Y, -Y -> distance traveled in the Y axis, used to tell the machine the height
AX:(+ or -) -> X end point difference from start point 0 if same. can be negative or positive
AY:(+ or -) -> Y end point difference from start point 0 if same. can be negative or positive

Each embroidery stitch comes in 3 bytes. The first being machine commands, followed by Y and finally X value(s)

stitch | Y = - | X = - |  END  | Color |  NA  |  NA  | Jump
    0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0
Y value
    0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0
X value
    0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0

X and Y are simple calculated using their literal binary value for a theoretical max stitch length of 255?
Machine commands are activated by having a 1 in its respective position
Here are some direct examples

10001000 or 88 = color switch and single stitch after wards
10000000 or 80 = single stitch
00000001 or 01 = jump
11111000 or f8 = end of machine file

The machine will always move BEFORE it stitches in a dsb file
Not sure if necessary but all existing examples show a single stitch after color change

UNIT CONVERSIONS

10 = 1mm so 1 = 0.1mm

1 inch = 25.4mm or 254
