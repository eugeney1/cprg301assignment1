Technical Embroidery Info

Embroidery thread will be assumed to be 0.35 mm width.
We can use this information to make pixes, and the *resolution* of the
converted image to embroidery. 

We will also need to devise a way to figure out gradients. Perhaps some sort of
zipper effect? likekly need to look into the logic behind converting normal images
to vector images.

Likely some sort of fill logic aswell.
 
Can just reduce the resolution of the inputed image and use pixel art?
